# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description
This project is a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in **Java** using the **Swing** library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows two players to take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

The project includes several key features:
- **Player choice**: Players can select whether they want to play as X or O at the start of the game.
- **Score tracking**: The game keeps track of scores for both players.
- **Reset functionality**: Players can reset the game to play again without restarting the application.

## Features
- **Player Marker Selection**: Before starting, players can choose to play as either X or O.
- **Interactive GUI**: The board is interactive, and players click to place their markers.
- **Real-time Score Tracking**: The game tracks how many rounds each player has won and displays the current score.
- **Reset Game**: A reset button allows the players to clear the board and play again while keeping the score.
  
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToe-Java.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the `TicTacToe.java` file:
   ```bash
   javac TicTacToe.java
   java TicTacToe
   ```
3. The game window will appear, and you can start playing by selecting your marker.

## Game Rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player X starts the game unless Player O is chosen at the beginning.
3. Players take turns placing their marker (X or O) in an empty cell.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
5. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language for the implementation.
- **Java Swing**: Used to create the graphical user interface.

## Future Enhancements
- Add AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Implement different board sizes (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5).
- Add sound effects and animations for a better gaming experience.
